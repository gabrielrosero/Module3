Module 3 - HTLM Document
========================

R Markdown
----------

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
plot(cars)
```

![](githubmd_document_files/figure-markdown_github/cars-1.png)

### Hear is a plot of the car set

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](githubmd_document_files/figure-markdown_github/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Hear is a plot of pressure set
